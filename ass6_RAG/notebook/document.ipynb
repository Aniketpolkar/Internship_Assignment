INTRODUCTION \\n \\nCloud Computing has emerged as one of the most transformative technologies in the \\nevolving digital landscape. It provides flexible, scalable, and cost-efficient \\ncomputational resources over the internet. The NPTEL Cloud Computing course \\noffers a complete understanding of cloud fundamentals, architectures, visualization \\ntechnologies, service models, security mechanisms, and advanced topics such as Fog \\nComputing, Serverless Computing, Cloud–Edge collaboration, and emerging research \\ntrends. \\n \\nThis report summarizes all 12 weeks of the course in detail, explaining key theories, \\nmechanisms, architectures, examples, case studies, and real-world applications. \\n2. WEEK 1 – Cloud Computing Overview & Architecture \\n2.1 Definition \\nCloud Computing is defined as a model that enables on-demand network access to a \\nshared pool of configurable computing resources (like networks, servers, storage, \\napplications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal \\nmanagement effort. \\n2.2 Essential Characteristics \\n1. On-Demand Self-Service – Users can access resources without human \\nintervention from the provider. \\n2. Broad Network Access – Services accessible from laptops, mobile, browsers. \\n3. Resource Pooling – Multi-tenancy and shared infrastructure. \\n4. Rapid Elasticity – Scaling up or down automatically. \\n5. Measured Service – Usage-based billing and monitoring. \\n2.3 Cloud Deployment Models \\n• \\nPublic Cloud – Hosted by third-party vendors. (AWS, GCP, Azure) \\n• \\nPrivate Cloud – Exclusively used by one organization. \\n• \\nHybrid Cloud – Combination of public and private. \\n• \\nCommunity Cloud – Shared by groups with common interests. \\n2.4 Cloud Architecture'),\n",
